# Tic_Tac_Toe

This exercise is inspired by the book "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python." 

I made the following updates to the original example:
  1. Changed to keypad as a reference for a three-by-three grid       
  2. Added the victory/tie conditions  
  3. Added the number of rounds played in a game
  4. Added a few messages 

Learning Objectives:
  1. Create a dictionary
  2. Define a function
  3. Use if/elif and for loop
